# App Initialization Bloc Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Import Path Mismatch
**Problem**: The main.dart file was importing files with incorrect paths:
- `app_initialization_bloc.dart` (doesn't exist)
- `app_initialization_event.dart` (doesn't exist) 
- `app_initialization_state.dart` (doesn't exist)

**Solution**: Updated imports to match actual file names:
- `appintilize_bloc.dart`
- Removed separate imports for event/state files (they are parts of the main bloc file)

### 2. Part/Part-of Declaration Issues
**Problem**: The part declarations were pointing to wrong file names:
- `part 'app_initialization_event.dart';`
- `part 'app_initialization_state.dart';`

**Solution**: Fixed part declarations to match actual file names:
- `part 'appintilize_event.dart';`
- `part 'appintilize_state.dart';`

### 3. Duplicate BlocProvider Creation
**Problem**: AppInitializationBloc was being created in two places:
1. In main() function's MultiBlocProvider
2. In AppInitializationWrapper's BlocProvider

**Solution**: Removed duplicate creation and kept only one instance in main() function.

### 4. Missing Flutter Import
**Problem**: `appintilize_bloc.dart` was missing the Flutter import for `TargetPlatform.iOS`.

**Solution**: Added `import 'package:flutter/material.dart';`

### 5. Unused Variables and Imports
**Problem**: 
- Unused import: `package_info_plus/package_info_plus.dart`
- Unused variable: `result` in `testSendMail` function

**Solution**: 
- Removed unused import
- Removed unused variable assignment

## Files Modified:

### `lib/main.dart`
- ✅ Fixed import paths for app initialization bloc
- ✅ Removed duplicate BlocProvider creation
- ✅ Removed unused import
- ✅ Fixed unused variable

### `lib/bloc/appintilize_bloc/appintilize_bloc.dart`
- ✅ Fixed part declarations to match actual file names
- ✅ Added missing Flutter import

### `lib/bloc/appintilize_bloc/appintilize_event.dart`
- ✅ Fixed part-of declaration to match actual file name

### `lib/bloc/appintilize_bloc/appintilize_state.dart`
- ✅ Fixed part-of declaration to match actual file name

## App Initialization Flow:

1. **Main Function**: Creates AppInitializationBloc and triggers StartInitialization event
2. **AppInitializationBloc**: Handles initialization sequence:
   - Request tracking permissions (iOS)
   - Check Firebase Auth state
   - Sync RevenueCat with user data (if user is logged in)
   - Update user login info and record app usage
3. **AppInitializationWrapper**: Listens to bloc state changes and navigates accordingly
4. **SplashScreen**: Shows loading animation during initialization

## Key Features:

- ✅ Proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- ✅ Non-blocking initialization (failures don't crash the app)
- ✅ Progress tracking with step descriptions
- ✅ Parallel execution where possible
- ✅ RevenueCat integration for subscription management
- ✅ Firebase Firestore integration for user data
- ✅ App tracking transparency compliance (iOS)

## Testing:

The app initialization should now work without compilation errors. The bloc will:
1. Show a splash screen during initialization
2. Handle errors gracefully
3. Navigate to the appropriate screen based on authentication state
4. Sync user data and subscription information

All linting errors have been resolved and the code is ready for testing.
